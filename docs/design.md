# akrealtyandconstruction.com

This is a website for my buisness. It is me, Md Habibul Islam (Kazal), and my partner Tareq Aziz (Nirob). 

### Design

- This website is for customers to find our buisness. We do contruction and home realty services. 
- The website should highlight the construction part of the buisness more than the realty services.
- There should be a logo in SVG format with a sopisticated design and a nice font.
- Should have picture of me and my partner from assets/images/md-profile.jpg for me, and for my partner I will put an image later so there should be placeholder.
- Both of us are licensed real estate agents under Winzone Realty Inc.
- My phone number is 1(718)-986-8012 and his phone number is 1(718)-710-8837.
- There should be a form where place where customers can request a quote.
- There are videos in assets/videos to be used for a fullscreen background video. All videos should be played after one another in the background. 
- Use the colors for the website:
    - #F1EFEC
    - #D4C9BE
    - #123458
    - #030303
- Use Helvetica font
- Some general ad information:
